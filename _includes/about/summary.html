<p>With my numerous game jam experiences and hobby projects, I've had the opportunity to design and deliver single- and multi-player experiences across various genres, using a range of engines including <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. These hands-on experiences have given me a strong foundation in game development, from solo projects to team collaborations.</p>
<p>For over 4 years, I've been a researcher at the University of Klagenfurt, working on various <strong>AR</strong> and <strong>VR</strong>-related projects using Unity. My current research focuses on point cloud streaming, for which I have developed XR apps with Unity, ported Unity VR apps to AR, trained ML models, and conducted subjective testing with a platform I developed myself. I'm currently working on integrating state-of-the-art point cloud streaming solutions using live low latency DASH and WebRTC. I have also been in-charge of various administrative tasks such as contributing to project deliverables and organising and running regular internal meetings.</p>
<p>I hold a <strong>Red-White-Red Card Plus</strong> that allows me <strong>unlimited labour market access in Austria without requiring a work permit</strong>.

<p>In addition to being fluent in <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Hindi</strong>, I have intermediate-level <strong>German</strong> skills (B2).</p>
