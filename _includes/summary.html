<p class="lead">a MSc Game Studies and Engineering graduate and Extended Reality researcher based in Klagenfurt, Austria. I'm looking to apply my skills and experience in the games industry as a designer or developer.</p>
<p>With my numerous game jam experiences and hobby projects, I've had the opportunity to design and deliver single- and multi-player experiences across various genres, using a range of engines including <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. This hands-on experience has given me a strong foundation in game development, from solo projects to team collaborations.</p>
<p>As a researcher at the University of Klagenfurt, Austria for 3 years, I've been working on various <strong>AR</strong> and <strong>VR</strong>-related projects using Unity. My current research focuses on point cloud streaming and has led to the publication of <strong>5 papers</strong> on this topic. This experience has given me a deep understanding of the technical aspects of XR development.</p>
<p>I hold a <strong>Red-White-Red Card Plus</strong> that allows me <strong>unlimited labour market access in Austria without requiring a work permit</strong>.<br />
    I'm now looking for opportunities in the industry as a game programmer, designer, or AR/VR software developer.<br />
    I'm also open to starting a PhD in games-oriented research or work as a research software engineer, making use of my experience in academia.

<p>In addition to being fluent in <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Hindi</strong>, I have intermediate-level <strong>German</strong> skills (A2-B1).</p>
