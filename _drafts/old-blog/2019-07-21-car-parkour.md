Car Parkour is a **3D multiplayer car racing** game with [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/) like mechanics. It was made as a hobby project over a weekend. The game uses assets from the [Racing Kit by Kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets/racing-kit).

It was built using the **Unity3D** engine and written in **C#**. I worked in a **team of two** on this, as a **level designer** and **programmer**.

The game can be found at [flywolfe.itch.io/car-parkour](https://flywolfe.itch.io/car-parkour), and hereâ€™s a gameplay sample:

*Following are some of my thoughts on the overall experience of developing the app. If you prefer to not read the rest of the post, you can go back to the portfolio home by clicking [here](/projects).*


## Background

Again, I wanted to make a game with cars due to my passion for cars. A friend wanted to make a game with [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/)-like mechanics. Hence, we decided to make a parkour game with cars in them. We used the [Racing Kit by Kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets/racing-kit) for this game because we both wanted to focus on programming. Summer holidays had also just arrived, and we both wanted to make a game before we left for our respective homes.

## Development Process

The game is basically what was said above: a parkour game with cars and Rocket League-like mechanics. However, we wanted to add another element to the game, and as my friend was focusing on the core mechanics, I decided to implement multiplayer.

This was my first time setting up multiplayer from scratch in Unity, as somebody else had done it during my previous multiplayer projects. We ended up having both a multiplayer and a single-player mode, allowing the player to choose between either.

## Final Thoughts. What did I learn?

Overall, we were satisfied with what we had created. I had successfully implemented multiplayer, which I was pretty proud of!

Implementing multiplayer was a new experience I was looking forward to since I love playing multiplayer games with friends. I learned the basics of networking and why some functionalities and some don't.
