    <h1 class="display-4"> Hi! I'm Shivi, </h1>
    <p class="lead">a MSc Game Studies and Engineering graduate and AR/VR researcher, currently looking to apply my skills and experience to the games industry in a design or development role.</p>
    <p>I have experience designing and developing single- and multi-player and 2D and 3D games, both individually and as part of a team, using Unity, Unreal Engine and other frameworks. </p>
    <p>I have been working as a researcher at the University of Klagenfurt for 3 years and currently use Unity to research various aspects related to point cloud streaming by developing apps for headsets such as the Microsoft HoloLens 2 and the Meta Quest 3. I have published 5 papers on the same.</p>
    <p>I hold a <strong>Red-White-Red Card Plus</strong> that allows me <strong>unlimited labour market access in Austria without requiring a work permit</strong>.
    <br> 
    I am currently <strong>looking for jobs as a game programmer or designer</strong>, or other positions that make use of my skills and experience, such as a research software engineer or an AR/VR software developer.
    <br>
    I am also open to starting a games-oriented PhD, advancing my career in academia.</p>
