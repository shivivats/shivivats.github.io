# Sorry if you're seeing this right now. This website is a WIP.

Hi all! I'm Shivi, a researcher at the [University of Klagenfurt, Austria](https://www.aau.at/). I've been working in this position for **3+ years** now on multiple [research](https://5gplayground.at/use-cases/#virtual-reality) [projects](https://www.spirit-project.eu/). I've worked with technologies ranging from [viewport prediction algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10019680/) to [Python web applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10019680/) to [developing AR apps in Unity for the HoloLens 2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10178443/). In the meanwhile, I've also written a Masters Thesis and published [5 papers](/publications) relating to my work.

### Past

I have a [Masters in Game Studies and Engineering](https://www.aau.at/en/studien/master-game-studies-and-engineering/), throughout the course of which I studied how to critically analyse games and some advanced topics related to developing them. I have a huge passion for video games, and while I have been out of game development for a few years, I am getting back into it now with Unreal Engine 5 (and unexpectedly, RenPy!). You can check out my game development projects [on this site](/projects) or on [zarroc.itch.io](https://zarroc.itch.io/).

I've also been messing about with various programming-related projects, such as developing discord bots .....

### Future

I'd like to transition to a more software-development focused role with:
- desktop or webapp development,
- research software development, or
- game development with either Unity or Unreal Engine.

I have relevant experience for all these fields and ....

### Misc.

- I love to run and play in TTRPG games. I've ran many one-shots along with a short-form campaign in a homebrewed world using [D&D 5e](https://dnd.wizards.com/) and few one-shots with [Mausritter](https://mausritter.com/).
- I'm a huge Pokemon nerd. But Skyrim, The Witcher 3, the Ori games, and Bloodborne are a few of my other favourites as well.
- I love music. I used to play the guitar and I'm now learning to play the drums. Plan to take singing lessons in the future!
- I dont use Facebook, Twitter, and the like, so please contact me via [email](mailto:shivivats7@gmail.com) (or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivivats/) can also work).
